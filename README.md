# Wheres Wally Assignment (C++)
An assignment I completed in my second year of Computer Science utilising C++. Here I was given a large "Where's Wally" image and a smaller image of Wally himself (not an exact match) and had to draw a square around where Wally appeared on the screen.

## Final Result

After processing the image using the search algorithm 'Nearest Neighbour Search' Wally has a box placed around him (top left of the image).

## What I learned From This Project

This project was a good opportunity to test the skills in Object Oriented Programming that I had been improving through independant projects. It was my first project utilising C++ and gave me a good understanding of using 2D arrays to represent a matrix. Looking back there is a lot I would change (particularly with the box that surrounds Wally) however I consider this to be the project that gave me the confidence to complete more complex tasks by utilising classes.
